We're excited to announce ERC721S, our open source extension to the ERC721 standard that adds native subscription functionality to NFTs.

## The Problem

Current NFT standards don't support recurring payments or time-based access. Projects resort to off-chain solutions or complex workarounds to implement subscription models.

## Our Solution

ERC721S extends ERC721 with:

- **Expiration timestamps** for each token
- **Renewal functions** for extending subscriptions
- **Grace periods** for lapsed subscriptions
- **Batch operations** for gas efficiency
