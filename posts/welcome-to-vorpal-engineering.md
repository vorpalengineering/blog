We're excited to launch the Vorpal Engineering blog! This is where we'll share our insights, research, and thoughts on blockchain security, smart contract development, and the broader Web3 ecosystem.

## What to Expect

Our blog will cover a range of topics including:

- **Security Research**: Deep dives into smart contract vulnerabilities, attack vectors, and defensive techniques
- **Audit Insights**: Lessons learned from our security audits (anonymized, of course)
- **Development Best Practices**: Tips for building secure, efficient smart contracts
- **Industry News**: Our take on the latest developments in blockchain security

## Our Mission

At Vorpal Engineering, we're committed to making Web3 safer for everyone. Through our audits, consulting, and open source contributions, we work to identify and prevent security vulnerabilities before they can be exploited.

> "Security is not a product, but a process." — Bruce Schneier

This philosophy guides everything we do. Security isn't a checkbox to tick off before launch—it's an ongoing commitment that requires constant vigilance and adaptation.

## Stay Connected

We'll be publishing new content regularly, so check back often. You can also follow us on [X/Twitter](https://x.com/vorpal_eng) and [GitHub](https://github.com/vorpalengineering) to stay up to date with our latest work.
