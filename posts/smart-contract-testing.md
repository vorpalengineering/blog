Thorough testing is your first line of defense against vulnerabilities. Here's our approach to smart contract testing.

## Testing Layers

1. **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions in isolation
2. **Integration Tests**: Test contract interactions
3. **Fuzz Testing**: Throw random inputs at your code
4. **Invariant Testing**: Verify properties that should always hold

## Tools We Recommend

- **Foundry**: Fast, Solidity-native testing framework
- **Hardhat**: JavaScript-based with great plugin ecosystem
- **Echidna**: Property-based fuzzing tool
- **Slither**: Static analysis for common vulnerabilities

No amount of testing replaces a professional audit, but good tests catch the obvious issues early.
